# Scopes in Vim

## Two main scopes
    * `i`: inner
    * `a`: around

## Now we can do these
    * `ciw`: change inner word
    * `daw`: delete around word
    * `dip`: delete inner paragraph
    * `yip`: yank inner word

## and moooore...
    * `ci(`: change inside bracket
    * `ci'`: change inside quotes

## Extra
    * `f`: find
    * `t`: till
