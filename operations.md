# Operations in Vim

## Operate on text objects with operations
    * `c`: change
    * `d`: delete
    * `y`: yank (or copy)

## operations need a text object to operate on

## examples
    * `cc`: change a line
    * `dd`: delete a line
    * `yy`: yank a line
    * `cw`/`dw`/`yw`: change/delete/yank a word

## But these don't extend very well to other text objects...
    * (try changing me)
    * "try changing me"
